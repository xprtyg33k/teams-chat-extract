# Copy this file to .env and fill in your credentials.
# The .env file is git-ignored and will not be committed.
#
# Usage:
# 1. Copy this file: cp .env.example .env
# 2. Fill in the IDs below (ask a coworker or admin if they already exist)
# 3. Run scripts without --tenant-id and --client-id arguments
#
# NOTE: These IDs are NOT secrets. They identify your organization and the
# app registration, not any individual user. They are safe to share with
# anyone in the same Azure AD tenant. Each user authenticates independently
# via the device-code flow and gets their own session token.

# Azure AD Tenant ID (one per organization)
# Get this from your admin, or Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > Properties

# Application (Client) ID (one per organization)
# Get this from your admin, or Azure Portal > App registrations > Your app
