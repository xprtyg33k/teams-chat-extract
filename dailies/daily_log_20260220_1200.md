## Summary
Completed cleanup of legacy CLI scripts and reorganization of project structure.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. CLI Script Cleanup
- **Moved legacy scripts** to `/cli/` folder:
  - `export_all_chats_2025.ps1`
  - `list_active_chats.py`
  - `list_chats.py`
  - `teams_chat_export.py`

- **Updated imports** in moved scripts to use relative imports (e.g., `from .teams_chat_export import ...`)

- **Updated test imports** to reference new locations (e.g., `from cli.teams_chat_export import ...`)

### 2. Validation
- **Ran full test suite**: All 67 tests pass
- **Coverage**: 35% on main module (`cli/teams_chat_export.py`)
- **Import validation**: Confirmed all modules load correctly

### 3. Project Structure
- **Root directory**: Now cleaner, focused on web/API components
- **CLI tools**: Organized in dedicated `/cli/` folder
- **Tests**: Remain at project level (test shared functionality used by both CLI and API)

## Notes
- Tests in `/tests/` correctly remain at project root as they validate core business logic shared between CLI and API
- `.gitignore` requires no updates (already covers moved files appropriately)
- API (`/api/`) and web UI (`/web/`) components unchanged
- All functionality preserved with updated import paths

## Next Steps
- Consider updating documentation (README, etc.) to reflect new CLI locations
- Update any CI/CD scripts that reference moved files
- Test CLI scripts from new `/cli/` directory
